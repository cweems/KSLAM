#Welcome to the first section of our KSLAM!

Today's work will consist of three sections:

* 1. Retrieving Data From an API
* 2. Processing and Validating Data
* 3. Making visualizations from your data

Side note: The document you are reading is posted on Github. You can think of Github as Dropbox or GoogleDocs for code. In more technical terms, it's a version control system based on a computer language known as git. It allows developers to collaboratively create and edit code.

#Section 1: Retrieving Data

We're going to start off the section by going through a simple lesson on Codecademy. Codecademy is a website that allows you to learn how to code in various languages in an online environment.

* 1. Go to: http://www.codecademy.com
* 2. If you think you might like to use Codecademy yourself, create an account by logging in via Google. Otherwise, have Charlie give you his login info.
